    "# Let's solve the new set of assignment questions one by one:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Q1. How do you comment code in Python? What are the different types of comments?\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Python, you can use comments to describe your code and make it more readable. There are two types of comments:\n",
    "# 1. **Single-line comments**: Use the `#` symbol to start a comment.\n",
    "# 2. **Multi-line comments**: Use triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`) to create a comment block that spans multiple lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# # This is a single-line comment\n",
    "\n",
    "# '''\n",
    "# This is a multi-line comment\n",
    "# which spans across multiple lines\n",
    "# '''\n",
    "\n",
    "# \"\"\"\n",
    "# This is another way to write\n",
    "# a multi-line comment\n",
    "# \"\"\"\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variables in Python are used to store data that can be manipulated and referenced in a program. You declare and assign values to variables by using the assignment operator `=`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# # Declaring and assigning values to variables\n",
    "# x = 10\n",
    "# y = 20.5\n",
    "# name = \"John\"\n",
    "# is_student = True\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Q3. How do you convert one data type to another in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can convert one data type to another using type conversion functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `list()`, `tuple()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# # Converting data types\n",
    "# a = 5\n",
    "# b = float(a)  # int to float\n",
    "# c = str(a)    # int to string\n",
    "# d = int(c)    # string to int\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Q4. How do you write and execute a Python script from the command line?\n",
    "\n",
    "# To write and execute a Python script from the command line, follow these steps:\n",
    "# 1. Create a Python script file with a `.py` extension, e.g., `script.py`.\n",
    "# 2. Write your Python code in the script file.\n",
    "# 3. Open the command line interface.\n",
    "# 4. Navigate to the directory where your script is located.\n",
    "# 5. Execute the script by typing `python script.py` (or `python3 script.py` if you are using Python 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# # Example Python script (script.py)\n",
    "# print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Q5. Given a list `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, write the code to slice the list and obtain the sub-list `[2, 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "# sub_list = my_list[1:3]\n",
    "# print(sub_list)  # Output: [2, 3]\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Q6. What is a complex number in mathematics, and how is it represented in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "# A complex number is a number that has both a real part and an imaginary part. It is represented in Python using the `complex` class. The imaginary part is denoted by the letter `j`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# # Representing a complex number\n",
    "# z = 3 + 4j\n",
    "# print(z)            # Output: (3+4j)\n",
    "# print(z.real)       # Output: 3.0\n",
    "# print(z.imag)       # Output: 4.0\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Q7. What is the correct way to declare a variable named `age` and assign the value 25 to it?\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# age = 25\n",
    "# print(age)  # Output: 25\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Q8. Declare a variable named `price` and assign the value 9.99 to it. What data type does this variable belong to?\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# price = 9.99\n",
    "# print(type(price))  # Output: <class 'float'>\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Q9. Create a variable named `name` and assign your full name to it as a string. How would you print the value of this variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# name = \"Your Full Name\"\n",
    "# print(name)\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Q10. Given the string \"Hello, World!\", extract the substring \"World\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# string = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "# substring = string[7:12]\n",
    "# print(substring)  # Output: World\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Q11. Create a variable named \"is_student\" and assign it a boolean value indicating whether you are currently a student or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# is_student = True  # or False, depending on your status\n",
    "# print(is_student)\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
